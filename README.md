A collection of my favourite recipes.

## Development

A handful of scripts to help development:

- `npm run start`: runs Grav in docker
- `npm run stop`: stops the docker instance
- `npm run start:clean`: recreate the docker image (in case of Grav version changes)

When running the docker instance, you can view the site at http://localhost:8081
