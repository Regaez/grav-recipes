1. Bring a saucepan of water to the boil, then add the spaghetti. While waiting for the water to boil, continue with following steps.

2. Chop the onion and crush the garlic. With a splash of oil in a saucepan, heat the onions and garlic.

3. When onions turn clear, add the mince. Make sure to separate thoroughly to prevent large lumps, then add in the chopped bacon and a splash of red wine vinegar.

4. When the meat has browned, add the tin of tomatoes, seasoning with salt, pepper, and mixed herbs. Also add in a squirt of tomato paste and make sure it's mixed well.

5. Don't forget to stir the spaghetti so it doesn't clump up!

6. Chop/grate some cheese.

7. Cook for 15min, then drain the spaghetti and serve mince. Sprinkle cheese over the top.
