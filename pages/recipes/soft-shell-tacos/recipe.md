1. Add a splash of oil to a saucepan, turn up to medium heat, then add diced onions.

2. Once onions have turned translucent, add the entire tin of refried beans, as well as the sweetcorn. Add the packet of taco spice and stir well. As the mixture heats up, turn down to a low heat. If necessary, add a splash of water to the pan to moisten.

3. Prepare the [cashew cream](/recipes/cashew-cream).
