1. Add a splash of oil to a saucepan, turn up to medium heat, then add diced onions.

2. Once onions have turned translucent, add the entire tin of refried beans, as well as the sweetcorn. Add the packet of taco spice and stir well. As the mixture heats up, turn down to a low heat. If necessary, add a splash of water to the pan to moisten.

3. Prepare the [cashew cream](/recipes/cashew-cream).

4. Quickly heat up 3 tacos per person, either by microwaving for 20s, or by tossing in a frying pan briefly over a medium heat.

5. Chop lettuce into small pieces, grate the carrot.

6. Assemble a taco by adding a tablespoon of bean mixture, a dollop of cashew cream, approximately 10g of lettuce and carrots, and a teaspoon of salsa.
