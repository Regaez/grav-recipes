1. Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion, bell pepper, and jalapeño and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 to 7 minutes, until the onion is tender and translucent.

2. Add the tomatoes, red curry paste and cook, stirring frequently, for about 5 minutes, until the tomatoes have released their juices and cooked down a bit.

3. Stir in the salt, allspice, red pepper flakes, cumin, cinnamon, cloves, kidney beans, and sweet potatoes, then pour in the broth. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then lower the heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 20 minutes.

4. Use an immersion blender to partially puree the soup so that about half of the sweet potato cubes and kidney beans are still visible and whole, or puree a about half of the soup in a standard blender and return to the pot.

5. Add the spinach and simmer for about 5 minutes, until the spinach has wilted. Stir in the coconut milk. If the soup is thicker than you'd like, add more broth to achieve the desired consistency. Taste and adjust seasonings if desired.
