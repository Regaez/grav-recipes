1. Pre-heat oven to 200 degrees celsius. While oven is starts to pre-heat, drain, dry and press tofu. Leave pressed while you prepare the marinade.

2. In a medium sized bowl, whisk together the sesame oil, tamari, garlic powder, maple syrup and vinegar.

3. Cut the pressed tofu into bite sized pieces (around 1cm cubes) and place in the oil mixture. Use a spoon or spatula to stir the tofu and make sure it’s completely coated.

4. Next, sprinkle over 1 tablespoon of the cornflour and mix well until all the tofu is coated. Then, sprinkle on another tablespoon of cornflour and give a gentle mix just until you can’t see the dry white powder anymore.

5. Line a large baking sheet with a non-stick mat or parchment paper.  Distribute the tofu on the tray so that none of the pieces are touching each other.  Bake for about 25-30 minutes, until golden and crispy. Around 15min, quickly toss the tofu so it cooks evenly on all sides. Let tofu sit for a few minutes to crisp up even more before enjoying.
