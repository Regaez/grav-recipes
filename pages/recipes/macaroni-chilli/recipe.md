1. Cook macaroni according to package directions, but decrease cooking time by 1 - 2 minutes. Once nearly al dente, drain.

2. While noodles are boiling, heat the oil in a large pot on medium-high heat and saut√© the onions and garlic until the onions are soft, about 3 - 5 minutes. Add splashes of water as needed to deglaze the pan.

3. Add the diced tomatoes, and rinse out the can with water (about 400 mL) adding this to the pot as well, along with the tomato paste, bouillon cube, and spices. Bring to a boil.

4. Once bubbling away, add the soy ground, carrot, bell pepper, and kidney beans. Cook until the carrots are soft, about 5 minutes.

5. Lastly, add the drained noodles and spinach. Cook for another minute, or until the spinach wilts and the pasta is al dente. Serve with desired garnish, and enjoy!
