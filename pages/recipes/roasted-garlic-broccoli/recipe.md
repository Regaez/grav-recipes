1. Preheat the oven to 180°C, and while waiting, cut the broccoli into small florets, placing in a bowl or saucepan.

2. Drizzle some olive oil and _liberally_ grind salt and pepper over the broccoli.

3. Chop the garlic and spread evenly over the florets. Toss the broccoli to mix the garlic with the oil and seasonings.

4. Place the broccoli on a baking tray. Ensure you distribute any leftover oil/garlic from the bowl onto the broccoli. Bake for 20 minutes until the broccoli is just starting to brown.

5. Finally, squeeze a wedge of fresh lemon juice over the broccoli right before serving. **This is essential.** The combination of lemon, garlic and pepper will fuse together to create a mouth-watering flavour.
