1. To a large pot on medium-high heat, add the oil. When hot, add the cumin, coriander, and mustard seeds, stirring for 30 - 60 seconds to toast the spices.

2. Then add to the pot the onion, and cook until translucent, about 3 - 5 minutes. Add splashes of water as needed to deglaze the pot.

3. Add the garlic and ginger, and cook until fragrant and lightly golden, about 2 minutes.

4. Add the bouillon cube, garam masala, turmeric, and cayenne, and cook while stirring for 30 - 60 seconds longer.

5. Add the potatoes and water. Cook until tender, about 15 minutes.

6. Add the peas, chickpeas, and coconut milk. Cook until warmed through.

7. Finally, add the spinach, and when wilted, remove from the heat. Serve while hot, with naan or rice, and garnish as desired. Enjoy!
