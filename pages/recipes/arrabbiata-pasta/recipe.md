1. Heat some oil in the wok on medium-high heat, then add the chopped onions and garlic, cooking until the onion is translucent.

2. Next, add the longer cooking vegetables (such as cauliflower, broccoli, carrot, green beans) and stir fry for a few minutes. Start boiling some salted water for the pasta. Afterwards, add the quicker cooking vegetables such as bell peppers, zucchini, mushrooms.

3. Once the water is boiling, start cooking the pasta.

4. Add the Arrabbiata sauce to the wok, stirring the sauce throughout the vege mix. After a few minutes, you may optionally throw in some cashews.

5. Once the pasta has finished cooking, drain and add to the wok, thoroughly mixing with the veges. Remove from heat and serve.
