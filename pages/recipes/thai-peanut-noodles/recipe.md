1. **To prepare the chicken marinade**, in a small-medium bowl, whisk together 3 tablespoons of tamari sauce, 1 tablespoon olive oil, finely grated zest of 1 lime, the juice from half of the lime, 3 cloves of minced garlic, and 1/2 teaspoons of chilli flakes. Once mixed, add the chicken pieces to the bowl and ensure the chicken is coated evenly. Cover and leave to sit in the fridge for 6-12 hours.

2. **To prepare the sauce**, combine the following ingredients in a small bowl and whisk until evenly blended: peanut butter, hot water, curry paste, 1 tablespoon tamari sauce, 1 clove of minced garlic, maple syrup, and the juice from the remaining half of the lime.

3. **To cook the rest of the meal**, bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat.

4. While the water is coming to a boil, also add the marinaded chicken to a frying pan and start cooking over a medium-high heat. Once cooked through, remove and put to the side.

4. Add the broccoli to the pot of boiling water and blanch for 1 minute. Add the snow peas and asparagus and blanch for 1 to 2 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, remove the vegetables from the water and transfer to a colander to drain completely.

5. Add the soba noodles to the boiling vegetable water and adjust the heat to maintain a low boil. Cook for approximately 5 minutes, until the noodles are tender but still firm. Then drain the noodles well and add back to the pot.

6. Add the vegetables, chicken, and 3/4 of the peanut sauce to the pot and stir gently to combine with the noodles.

7. To serve, divide the noodle mix evenly among four bowls and drizzle the remaining sauce over the top. Additionally, you could add a few dashes of sriracha sauce for extra spicy flavour.
